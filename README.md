# Simulating Triboelectric NanoGenerators[TENG] in Sliding Mode 

###Project Description:

The "Simulation of Triboelectric Nanogenerator (TENG) in Sliding Mode using COMSOL" project aims to investigate and model the electrical energy generation process through the triboelectric effect using a specific material pairing: PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) as the triboelectrically negative element and nylon as the triboelectrically positive element. This project leverages the capabilities of COMSOL Multiphysics, a powerful finite element analysis software, to simulate and analyze the behavior of the TENG system in a sliding mode configuration.

The triboelectric effect is a phenomenon where the contact and separation of two dissimilar materials results in the transfer of electric charges between them. This effect can be harnessed to develop energy harvesting devices like TENGs, which convert mechanical energy, often from human motion or environmental vibrations, into electrical energy.

The "Simulation of Triboelectric Nanogenerator in Sliding Mode using COMSOL" project holds significance in advancing the understanding of energy harvesting mechanisms and contributing to the development of efficient TENG devices. The outcomes will have applications in wearable electronics, IoT devices, and self-powered systems, with potential implications for renewable energy generation and sustainable technologies.
